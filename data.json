    "text": "My name is MD Islam, and software engineering is my passion and my career goal. Ever since I was a young child, I have wanted to pursue software development and I realized I could do it with Computer Science. When I become inspired to create a software project, I commit to it and try to develop a MVP (see projects section). When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading light novels, watching anime, and TV shows.",
